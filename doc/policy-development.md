# Policy Development

## Recommended readings

Newcomers to APIcast development might be interested in the following resources.

At first, you might need to learn the Lua language (with a focus on version 5.1/5.2).
The [Lua 5.1 Reference Guide](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) should be your first read
and followed by [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/).

Then, we suggest learning Nginx with the [agentzh's Nginx Tutorials](https://openresty.org/download/agentzh-nginx-tutorials-en.html).

You might then learn OpenResty [by reading its documentation](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module),
full of examples and going through the [Getting Started Tutorial](http://openresty.org/en/getting-started.html).

As you start writing your first APIcast policy, you might be interested in
[the OpenResty resources](http://openresty.org/en/resources.html), that present
real world use cases and their implementation using OpenResty.
